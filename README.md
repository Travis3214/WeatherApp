# Weather-App

## Description
This is a weather dashboard that uses an API from 'OpenWeather' to deliver weather information about a city of the users choice. The user can type in a city name into the input field, press the search button, and the page will use the API to dynamically generate the weather information of that city. It will give the user the temperature, wind, humidity, and even a 5-day forecast for the week ahead. It saves the users input into the search history so they can easily go back and view that cities weather information again.
